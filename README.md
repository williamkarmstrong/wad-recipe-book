WAD project team 7

To Use:
1. Clone the repository using git clone 
2. CD into the project directory and from the terminal run: pip install -r requirements.txt

Branching:
1. `git checkout -b feature-yourname` will create a new branch, we can all create a branch and use it through the whole project. Merge changes after you've done a task.
2. `git push -u origin feature-yourname` sets up tracking between your branch and the remote repository here on GitHub
3. `git fetch origin` to get any changes without affecting your working directory (do this before merging) 

Pushing changes:
1. `git add .` add all changes to staging
2. `git commit -m "short message describing changes"`
3. `git push origin feature-yourname` push changes to main
Then we can make sure there are no conflicts in merging the branch into main
